# MH3QuestRepacker
 Unpacker and Repacker for .quest files or files found in quest00.arc

# How to Use
 - Drag quest files onto the executable and you'll get a .txt after telling it whether the quest file is JP or not. If it's not, you'll get a .ustxt, this is just a .txt with a different extension.
 - Edit the .txt/.ustxt and drag it back onto the executable, do not delete the original quest file. It will be replaced with the repacked one.
