# MH3QuestRepacker
 Unpacker and Repacker for .quest files or files found in quest00.arc

# How to Use
 - Drag quest files onto the executable and you'll get a .txt after telling it whether the quest file is JP or not.
 - Edit the .txt and drag it back onto the executable, do not delete the original quest file. Tell the prompt which version it is again and the original quest file will be replaced with the repacked one.
